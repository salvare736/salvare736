### Hi there, I'm Sergio! ðŸ‘‹

I have donned many hats in my professional ventures, but coding is what resonated with me most of all. 

What makes coding so exciting is its fast pace and the fact that there is always something new to learn on the horizon. I am a big believer in the growth mindset, and so I will always aim to foster the learning process for myself and for my colleagues. There is always room for improvement!
